# First EDA Project


This is my first own EDA project as part of the Data Science Bootcamp at **neuefische GmbH**. 



* The project is about a steakholder who wants to buy a house. My task is to make recommendations based on the data of the King County Housing dataframe which satisfy the requirements of my steakholder.
* there is a markdown file called [column_names](column_names.md) in the data folder where you can look up the description of the column names of the dataset
* in the folder notebooks you will find two Notebooks. One of them is quiet clean, the other one is messed up. According to the names of the notebooks you should be abled to choose the right one. Otherwise click --> [First_EDA_King_County_Housing_Data](First_EDA_King_County_Housing_Data.ipynb) to get the right one



**Have fun with my first EDA project!**
