# First EDA Project


This is my first own EDA project as part of the Data Science Bootcamp at **neuefische GmbH**. 



* The project is about a steakholder who wants to buy a house. My task is to make recommendations based on the data of the King County Housing dataframe which satisfy the requirements of my steakholder.
* there is a markdown file called [column_names](column_names.md) in the data folder where you can look up the description of the column names of the dataset
* in the folder notebooks you will [First_EDA_King_County_Housing_Data](First_EDA_King_County_Housing_Data.ipynb) 



**Have fun with my first EDA project!**
